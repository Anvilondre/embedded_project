This little project aims to design an *anti-bark* system to play loud pre-recorded commands if barking is sensed.  
We use TinyML for keyword detection, that uses [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) and is based on the example by [ShawnHymel](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/ei-keyword-spotting).
